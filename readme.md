# Travel Web Slicing ✈️

Just for fun, I got bored doing backend things😞, so I started to learn HTML and CSS again because I didn't know how to center the <code>< div ></code> 😩
    

This project use Alpine Js and Tailwind CSS

### How to run the project?
- Just clone the repo
- Run <code>npm install</code>
- and the last one, run <code>npm run dev</code> 
- use Live Server Extension or directly open the index.html on your favourite browser, and the Plane ready for take off 🛫.


My task is not complete yet, I only created the navbar and hero section.
